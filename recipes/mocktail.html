    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Anyone doing a dry challenge or looking to give up alcohol altogether? If you want a grown-up cocktail without the alcohol, you'll love this healthy pink Grapefruit-Ginger Kombucha Mocktail! I love my cocktails, but I also like to take a break occasionally. It can be tough to find nonalcoholic cocktails that have complex flavors and feel sophisticated, which is why I love this simple kombucha mocktail. The kombucha adds zing and gut-health benefits, and the best part is no hangover the next day! For another easy grapefruit mocktail, try my Zero- Proof Jalapeño Paloma.</p>
