    <h1>Air Fryer Sweet Potato Fries</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These healthy air fryer sweet potato fries are perfectly seasoned and made with just a small amount of oil! Perfect with burgers!<p>These are the best air fryer sweet potato fries! They are so crispy, flavorful and easy to make in the air fryer. Here I share two methods, a quick method that is delicious and a longer method that comes out perfectly crisp. Both taste great, feel free to use the method you prefer! Since you only need a little oil, they are also lighter and healthier than deep frying. One of my first recipes I ever made with my air fryer. Since then I have published two air fryer cookbooks and hundreds of air fryer recipes! Serve them with turkey burgers, or as a snack with your favorite dipping sauce.
